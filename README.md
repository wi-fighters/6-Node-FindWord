## Instructions for students:

### Find the Word

Create a program to search files for a word. The program should accept a word and a file path.

-   Make sure to create index.js, use createReadStream to read the data.txt file from this repository.

-   Make sure you separate the data in chunks, by default when you run the program to check the data.txt it should find the word 'localhost', and it should give you the amount of times that the word appears in that file. 

See following example:

```bash
$ node index.js
Reading chunk 1
Reading chunk 2
Reading chunk 3
Reading chunk 4
Reading chunk 5
Reading chunk 6
Reading chunk 7
Reading chunk 8
End of data
Number of chunks: 8
Found 'localhost' 1 times
```

-   The program should also be able to find any word that you pass as an argument. The output should look like the following example:

```bash
$ node index.js function
Reading chunk 1
Reading chunk 2
Reading chunk 3
Reading chunk 4
Reading chunk 5
Reading chunk 6
Reading chunk 7
Reading chunk 8
End of data
Number of chunks: 8
Found 'function' 8 times
```

-   The program should be able to find words from other files. You will pass the word to find as the first argument and the path to your file as a second argument on your program.  

- Example to find a word from other path: 

```bash
node index.js individual ../node-PrintKeyboard/README.md 
Open big file chunk by chunk and count a word
 
Reading chunk 1
End of data
Number of chunks: 1
Found 'individual' 1 times
```

**Bonus**

-   Run on your program **" "** as the word argument. It should find the correct amount of times that a space appears on a file.

### Rules

-   This is an individual assignment.
-   Deadline: 30 minutes.
-   Use **Git properly**
